# CNN_Model_Using_GoogleNet_Architecture
Trained a deep convolutional neural network using a pretrained model architecture called "Inception," with a specific variant named "GoogLeNet." The Inception architecture was designed to improve the utilization of computing resources within the network, allowing for increased depth and width while keeping the computational budget constant.
